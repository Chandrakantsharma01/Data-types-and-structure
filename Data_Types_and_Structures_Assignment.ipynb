It achieves this efficiency by using a hash function to map keys to specific indices (or \"buckets\") within an underlying array. When you want to store a key-value pair, the hash function processes the key to generate an index, and the value is then stored at that location. When retrieving a value, the same hash function is applied to the key to quickly locate the corresponding value.\n",
